## Installation

### Download

### Set FFmpeg path

1. [Download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) the FFmpeg 4.4 binary and put it somewhere.
2. Edit the `AppSettings.json` file to set the path to FFmpeg's `bin` directory.

Or just run the `download_ffmpeg.bat` file.

## Limitations

- Video playback synchronization is not frame-accurate, not perfect.
